Second Largest Element In Tree

Algorithm :

    A simple solution is to traverse the array twice. In the first traversal find the maximum
    value node. In the second traversal find the greatest element node less than the element
    obtained in first traversal. The time complexity of this solution is O(n).

    An Efficient Solution can be to find the second largest element in a single traversal.
    Below is the complete algorithm for doing this:

        1) Initialize two nodes first and second to NULL as,
           first = second = NULL
        2) Start traversing the tree,
           a) If the current node data say root->key is greater
              than first->key then update first and second as,
              second = first
              first = root
           b) If the current node data is in between first and
              second, then update second to store the value
              of current node as
                second = root
        3) Return the node stored in second.
