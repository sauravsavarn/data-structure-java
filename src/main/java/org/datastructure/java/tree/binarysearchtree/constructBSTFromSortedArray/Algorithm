Construct BST from Sorted Array

Algorithm :
    1. Take the MIDDLE element and create root node
    2. Take left side of middle of array and pass them
       Recursively to get the Left Sub-Tree
    3. Use right side elements to get Right Sub-Tree
    4. Connect these Sub-Tree's with the root node
    5. Finally, return the root node
