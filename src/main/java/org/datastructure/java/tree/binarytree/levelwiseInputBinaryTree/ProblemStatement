Levelwise Input Binary Tree

Algorithm :
    1. Take root input
    2. Insert it into a queue
    3. while queue is not empty
        i. take the first element out
       ii. create for it's left
                if left != -1
                    attach it to the element on the left-side
                    & push left to the queue.
      iii. create for it's right
                if right != -1
                    attach it to the elemnt in the right-side
                    & push right to the queue
