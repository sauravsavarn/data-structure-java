Construct Tree Using Inorder and Postorder

Algorithm :
    1. Find the root [HINT: this is last element of postorder array i.e. postorder[postorder.length-1] ]
    2. Find Inorder of both left & right subtree
        [HINT: Search for root in Inorder, all left element is Inorder of left subtree &
               all right element is Inorder of right subtree ]
    3. Find Postorder of both left & right subtree
        [HINT: Search for total number of elements {i.e. elements count from Inorder of left subtree}
               from 0th element of Postorder array[], which is Postorder of left Subtree & all
               other remaining number of elements minus last element (i.e. which is the root)
               is Postorder of right subtree]
    4. Use Recursion to build LEFT & RIGHT Subtree.
    5. Connect root with both
