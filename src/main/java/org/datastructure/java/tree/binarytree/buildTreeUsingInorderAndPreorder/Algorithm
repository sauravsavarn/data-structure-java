Construct Tree Using Inorder and Preorder

Algorithm :
    1. Find the root [HINT: this is 0th element of preorder array i.e. preorder[0] ]
    2. Find Inorder of both left & right subtree
        [HINT: Search for root in Inorder, all left element is Inorder of left subtree &
               all right element is Inorder of right subtree ]
    3. Find Preorder of both left & right subtree
        [HINT: Search for total number of elements {i.e. elements count from Inorder of left subtree}
               from root which is Preorder of left Subtree & all other remaining number of elements is
               Preorder of right subtree]
    4. Use Recursion to build LEFT & RIGHT Subtree.
    5. Connect root with both
