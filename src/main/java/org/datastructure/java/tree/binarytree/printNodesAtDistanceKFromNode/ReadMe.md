THIS PROBLEM IS SOLVED USING BOTH 
    1. RECURSIVE WAY : ref. Solution1
            ----- to try with this approach, call this Class Solution1 inside the Runner.java.
            ----- NOTE: this Solution i.e. Solution1 is still incomplete and the approach needs to re-work
                        for correct and optimal Solution. So till further info please do not try this approach.
    2. RECURSIVE WAY : ref. Solution2 ///////THIS IS MOST OPTIMAL and also current working SOLUTION
            ----- to stop using this approach, comment inside the Runner.java and write for Solution1.
