THIS PROBLEM IS SOLVED USING BOTH 
    1. RECURSIVE WAY : ref. Solution1
            ----- to stop using this approach, comment inside the Runner.java and write for Solution2.
    2. RECURSIVE WAY : ref. Solution2 ///////THIS IS MOST OPTIMAL SOLUTION FOR VERY-VERY LARGE INPUT
            ----- to try with this approach, call this Class Solution2 inside the Runner.java
        
        ----- NOTE: Solution2 & Solution1, they are both Recursive way to solve this problem,
                    but Solution2 is the most elegant than Solution1 approach of solving this.
