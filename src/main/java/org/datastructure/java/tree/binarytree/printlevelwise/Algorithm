Levelwise Input Binary Tree

Algorithm :
    1. Add root node to the queue
    2. while queue is not empty
        i. take the first element out
       ii.
            a. print out the first element
            b. check for the element's children, if not null then add them to the queue as per below logic:
                i. check for the left node of the element
                    if left != -1
                        push left to the queue.
               ii. check for the right node of the element
                    if right != -1
                        push right to the queue.
