IDEA :
    What are the subproblems in this case?
    The idea is process all characters one by one staring from either from left or right sides of
    both strings.
    Let us traverse from right corner, there are two possibilities for every pair of character being
    traversed.

        m: Length of str1 (first string)
        n: Length of str2 (second string)

        1.  If last characters of two strings are same, nothing much to do. Ignore last characters
            and get count for remaining strings. So we recur for lengths m-1 and n-1.
        2.  Else (If last characters are not same), we consider all operations on ‘str1’, consider
            all three operations on last character of first string, recursively compute minimum cost
            for all three operations and take minimum of three values.

            1.  Insert: Recur for m and n-1
            2.  Remove: Recur for m-1 and n
            3.  Replace: Recur for m-1 and n-1
