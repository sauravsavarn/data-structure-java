Minimum Number of Chocolates

PROBLEM :
     Given an array A[] consisting of N integers, where each value represents the marks of the ith
     student, the task is to find the minimum number of chocolates required to be distributed
     such that:

        Each student should be awarded with at least one chocolate
        A student with higher marks should be awarded more chocolates than his adjacent students.

     Examples:

        Input: A[] = {10, 30, 20}
        Output: 4
        Explanation : Since, 30 is larger than its adjacent, so the second student must get more
                      chocolates. Therefore, the minimum chocolates can be distributed
                      as {1, 2, 1} = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

        Input: A[] = {23, 14, 15, 14, 56, 29, 14}
        Output: 12

APPROACH :
     1. Initialize an auxiliary array DP[] of length N with 1.
     2. Traverse from left to right from i = 1 to N – 1,
        updating DP[i] as DP[i] = DP[i-1]+1 if A[i] greater the A[i-1].
     3. After completing the above step, traverse again from right to left from
        i = N – 2 to 0, updating DP[i] as DP[i] = DP[i+1]+1 iff A[i] is greater than A[i + 1]  AND
        DP[i] <= DP[i+1]+1
     4. After traversing, calculate the sum of the array DP[] and print it as the minimum number of
        chocolates required.

     Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the length of the given array.
