Longest subset zero sum

Naive Approach:
    This involves the use of brute force where two nested loops are used. The outer loop
    is used to fix the starting position of the sub-array, and the inner loop is used for
    the ending position of the sub-array and if the sum of elements is equal to zero, then
    increase the count.


Algorithm :

    Consider all sub-arrays one by one and check the sum of every sub-array.
    Run two loops: the outer loop picks the starting point i and the inner loop tries all
    sub-arrays starting from i.

Complexity Analysis:

    Time Complexity: O(n^2) due to the use of nested loops.
    Space complexity: O(1) as no extra space is used.
