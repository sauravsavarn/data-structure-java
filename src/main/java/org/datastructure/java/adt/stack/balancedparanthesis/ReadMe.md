THIS PROBLEM IS SOLVED USING BOTH 
    1. RECURSIVE WAY : ref. Solution1
        ----- to try with this approach, uncomment inside the Runner.java
        ----- NOTE: here Stack Data-Structure is implemented using LinkedList.
    2. ITERATIVE WAY : ref. Solution2 
        ----- to try with this approach, uncomment inside the Runner.java
        ----- NOTE: here Stack Data-Structure is implemented using LinkedList.
    3. ITERATIVE WAY : ref. Solution3 ///////THIS IS MOST OPTIMAL SOLUTION FOR VERY-VERY LARGE INPUT
        ----- to stop using this approach, comment inside the Runner.java and uncomment for Solution1 or Solution2.
        ----- NOTE: here Stack Data-Structure is implemented using Array.
              Because here Stack is implemented using Array, which gives performance benefits and
              avoids Runtime Error(s) like StackOverflow or OutOfMemory Error, as Stack implementation
              using Array takes performance benefits over LinkedList.
