Sum of digits (recursive)

Write a recursive function that returns the sum of the digits of a given integer.

    Input format :
        Integer N

    Output Format :
        Sum of digits of N

    Constraints :
        0 <= N <= 10^9

    Sample Input 1 :
        12345
    Sample Output 1 :
        15

    Sample Input 2 :
        9
    Sample Output 2 :
        9
