Pair Star

Given a string S, compute recursively a new string where identical chars that are adjacent in
the original string are separated from each other by a "*".

    Input format :
        String S

    Output Format :
        Modified string

    Constraints :
        0 <= |S| <= 1000
        where |S| represents length of string S.

    Sample Input 1 :
        hello
    Sample Output 1 :
        hel*lo

    Sample Input 2 :
        aaaa
    Sample Output 2 :
        a*a*a*a
