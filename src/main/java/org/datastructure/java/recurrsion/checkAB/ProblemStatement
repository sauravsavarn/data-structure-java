Check AB

Suppose you have a string, S, made up of only 'a's and 'b's. Write a recursive function that
checks if the string was generated using the following rules:

    a. The string begins with an 'a'
    b. Each 'a' is followed by nothing or an 'a' or "bb"
    c. Each "bb" is followed by nothing or an 'a'

If all the rules are followed by the given string, return true otherwise return false.

    Input format :
        String S

    Output Format :
        'true' or 'false'

    Constraints :
        1 <= |S| <= 1000
        where |S| represents length of string S.

    Sample Input 1 :
        abb
    Sample Output 1 :
        true

    Sample Input 2 :
        abababa
    Sample Output 2 :
        false
