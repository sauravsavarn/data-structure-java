Number of Digits

Given the code to find out and return the number of digits present in a number recursively.
But it contains few bugs, that you need to rectify such that all the test cases should pass.

    Sample Code to find BUG and RESOLVE
        public class Solution {

            public static int count(int n){
                if(n == 0){
                    return 1;
                }
                int smallAns = count(n / 10);
                return smallAns + 1;
            }

        }

    Input Format :
        Integer n

    Output Format :
        Count of digits

    Constraints :
        1 <= n <= 10^6

    Sample Input 1 :
        156
    Sample Output 1 :
        3

    Sample Input 2 :
        7
    Sample Output 2 :
        1
