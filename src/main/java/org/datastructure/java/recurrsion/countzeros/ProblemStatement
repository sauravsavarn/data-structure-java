Count Zeros

Given an integer N, count and return the number of zeros that are present in the given integer
using recursion.

    Input format :
        Integer N

    Output Format :
        Number of zeros in N

    Constraints :
        0 <= N <= 10^9

    Sample Input 1 :
        0
    Sample Output 1 :
        1

    Sample Input 2 :
        00010204
    Sample Output 2 :
        2

    Sample Input 3 :
        708000
    Sample Output 3 :
        4

Using Recurrsion which Involves the basic principle of PMI (Principle of Mathematical Induction)
