THIS PROBLEM IS SOLVED USING BOTH 
    1. RECURSIVE WAY : ref. Solution1
            ----- to try with this approach, uncomment Solution1 call inside the Runner.java
    2. RECURSIVE WAY : ref. Solution2 ///////THIS IS MOST OPTIMAL SOLUTION
            ----- to try with this approach, uncomment Solution1 call inside the Runner.java
    3. RECURSIVE WAY : ref. Solution2 ///////THIS IS MOST OPTIMAL SOLUTION
            ----- to stop using this approach, comment inside the Runner.java.
            
   ----- NOTE: BOTH Solution2 & Solution3 is the RECURSIVE WAY of Implementation, to solve this problem,
               but Solution2 & Solution3 is the most elegant than Solution1 approach of solving this.
               In Solution2 & Solution3, we find all the keypadCode during Recursion with smallerInput
               only instead of 1st going down to bottom and then summing-up to the top
