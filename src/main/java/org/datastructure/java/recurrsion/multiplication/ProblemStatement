Multiplication (Recursive)

Given two integers M & N, calculate and return their multiplication using recursion.
You can only use subtraction and addition for your calculation. No other operators are allowed.

    Input format :
        Line 1 : Integer M
        Line 2 : Integer N

    Output Format :
        M x N

    Constraints :
        0 <= M <= 1000
        0 <= N <= 1000

    Sample Input 1 :
        3
        5
    Sample Output 1 :
        15

    Sample Input 2 :
        4
        0
    Sample Output 2 :
        0
