changes in the board.

    Input Format :
        Line 1 : Integer n (Total number of moves)
        Line 2 : Player 1 coordinates, x and y (Two integers separated by space)
        Line 3 : Player 2 coordinates, x and y (Two integers separated by space)

    Note 1 : Number of moves (i.e. n) is always even and Player 1 always starts the game.
    Note 2 : If any player's coordinates are not valid, enter again till the right move.
    Main function is given for you reference.
