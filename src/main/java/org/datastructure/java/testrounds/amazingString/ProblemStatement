Amazing Strings

    Shrey has just arrived in the city. When he entered the city, he was given two strings.
    Now, after arriving at his college, his professor gave him an extra string. To check his
    intelligence, his professor told him to check if the third string given to him has all
    the characters of the first and second strings in any order. Help Shrey before his
    professor scolds him. He has to answer “YES” if all characters are present else “NO”.

    Example: ‘HELLO’ and ‘SHREY’ are two initial strings, and his professor gave him ’HLOHEELSRY’.
             So, here all the characters are present, so he has to say “YES”.

    Note: The strings contain only uppercase Latin characters.

    Input format :
        The first line contains a single integer ‘T’ representing the number of test cases.

        The first line of each test case contains three strings, and the first two strings,
        i.e. ‘FIRST’ and ‘SECOND’ are the strings which he was given at the beginning, and
        the third string is ‘THIRD’, which was given by the professor.

    Output Format :
        For each test case, you have to return “YES” if all characters are present in the
        third string of the first and second strings; else, return “NO”.

        Print the output of each test case in a separate line.

        Note:
            You don’t need to print anything; It has already been taken care of.

    Constraints :
        1 <= T <= 10^2
        1 <= |FIRST|, |SECOND|, |THIRD| <= 10^5

        Time Limit: 1 sec

    Sample Input 1 :
        3 4
    Sample Output 1 :
        81

    Sample Input 2 :
        2 5
    Sample Output 2 :
        32
