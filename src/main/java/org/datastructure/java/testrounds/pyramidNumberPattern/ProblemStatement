Pattern: Triangle of numbers

    Ninja is given a pattern. Now he is asked to print the same pattern for any given ‘N’
    number of rows.

    For example, Pattern for ‘N’ = 4 will be.
           1
          232
         34545
        4567654

    Input format :
        The first line contains an integer 'T' which denotes the number of test cases or
        queries to be run.

        The first line of each test case contains a single integer ‘N’ denoting the number
        of rows for which pattern needs to be printed.

    Output Format :
        The output of each test case will be 'N' strings denoting the pattern printed for
        the given ‘N’ number of rows.

        Output of each test case will be printed on a separate line.

    Constraints :
        1 <=T <= 5
        1 <= N <= 100

        Where ‘T’ is the total number of test cases and ‘N’ is the given number of rows for which pattern needs to be printed.

    Sample Input 1 :
        1
        5
    Sample Output 1 :
            1
           232
          34543
         4567654
        567898765

    Explanation of Sample Input 1:
        For test case 1:
        We print the given pattern for the given 5 rows where each row prints spaces initially for
        each row decrementing for each consecutive row and printing the values corresponding to
        each row according to the given pattern.

    Sample Input 2 :
        1
        4
    Sample Output 2 :
           1
          232
         34545
        4567654

    Explanation of Sample Input 2:
        For test case 1:
        We print the given pattern for the given 4 rows where each row prints spaces initially
        for each row decrementing for each consecutive row and printing the values corresponding
        to each row according to the given pattern.
