Add binary strings

    You have been given two binary strings ‘A’ and ‘B’. Your task is to find the sum of both
    strings in the form of a binary string.

    Binary strings are the representation of integers in the binary form. For example, the
    binary strings of 9 and 16 are “1001” and “10000” respectively.

    Input format :
        The first line contains a single integer ‘T’ representing the number of test cases.

        The second line contains two space-separated integers ‘N’ and ‘M’ which are the length
        of strings ‘A’ and ‘B’ respectively.

        The third line of each test case will contain two space-separated binary strings
        ‘A’ and ‘B’ as described above.

    Output Format :
        For each test case, print the sum of the given binary strings in a binary form.

        Output for every test case will be printed in a separate line.

        Note:
            You don’t need to print anything; It has already been taken care of. Just
            implement the given function.

    Constraints :
        1 <= T <= 5
        1 <= N, M <= 5000

        ‘A’ and ‘B’ consist only of '0' or '1' characters.

        Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

    Sample Input 1 :
        2
        2 2
        10 01
        3 2
        111 10
    Sample Output 1 :
        11
        1001

    Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
        In the first test case, the first string is “10” which is 2 in the decimal format, and
        the second string is “01” which is 1 in the decimal format. So, 2 + 1 = 3, which is
        represented as “11” in binary form.

        In the first test case, the first string is “111” which is 7 in the decimal format, and
        the second string is “10” which is 2 in the decimal format. So, 7 + 2 = 9, which is
        represented as “1001” in binary form.

    Sample Input 2 :
        2
        3 1
        111 0
        1 1
        1 1

    Sample Output 2 :
        111
        10

    Explanation For Sample Input 2:
        In the first test case, the first string is “111” which is 7 in the decimal format,
        and the second string is “0” which is 0 in the decimal format. So, 7 + 0 = 0, which
        is represented as “111” in binary form.

        In the first test case, the first string is “1” which is 1 in the decimal format and
        the second string is “1” which is 1 in the decimal format. So, 1 + 1 = 2, which is
        represented as “10” in binary form.
