Print the Pattern

    Ninja is given a pattern. Now he is asked to print the same pattern for any
    given ‘N’ number of rows.

    Note:
        There is only one space between the values of each column in a row.

        For example, Pattern for ‘N’ = 5 will be.
        1 2 3 4 5
        11 12 13 14 15
        21 22 23 24 25
        16 17 18 19 20
        6 7 8 9 10

    Input format :
        The first line contains an integer 'T' which denotes the number of test cases or
        queries to be run.

        The first line of each test case contains a single integer ‘N’ denoting the number
        of rows for which pattern needs to be printed.

    Output Format :
        The output of each test case will be 'N' strings denoting the pattern printed for
        the given ‘N’ number of rows.

        The output of each test case will be printed on a separate line.

    Constraints :
        1 <=T <= 5
        1 <= N <= 100

        Where ‘T’ is the total number of test cases and ‘N’ is the given number of rows for which pattern needs to be printed.

        Time limit: 1 sec

    Sample Input 1 :
        1
        5
    Sample Output 1 :
        1 2 3 4 5
        11 12 13 14 15
        21 22 23 24 25
        16 17 18 19 20
        6 7 8 9 10

    Explanation of Sample Input 1:
        For test case 1:
        We print the given pattern for the given 5 rows where each row has different values
        in increasing order with a difference in the value of 1 between each element and 1
        space between each column in a row.

    Sample Input 2 :
        1
        4
    Sample Output 2 :
        1 2 3 4
        9 10 11 12
        13 14 15 16
        5 6 7 8

    Explanation of Sample Input 2:
        For test case 1:
        We print the given pattern for the given 4 rows where each row has different values
        in increasing order with a difference of 1 in the value of 1 between each element
        and 1 space between each column in a row.
