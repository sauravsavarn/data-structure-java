THIS PROBLEM IS SOLVED USING BOTH 
    1. ITERATIVE + RECURSIVE WAY : ref. Solution1 (Trie1)
            ----- to try with this approach, call this Class Trie1 inside the Runner.java
    2. ITERATIVE + RECURSIVE WAY : ref. Solution2 (Trie2) ///////THIS IS MOST OPTIMAL SOLUTION
            ----- to stop using this approach, comment inside the Runner.java and write for Solution1.
            
   ----- NOTE: BOTH Solution2 (i.e. Trie2) & Solution1 (i.e. Trie1) is the combination of 
               ITERATIVE & RECURSIVE WAY of Implementation, to solve this problem,
               but Solution2 is the most elegant than Solution1 approach of solving this.
               In Solution2, we avoid using extra loops to check for Palindrome Existence and 
               the approach is the crude brute force solution which takes much larger time in 
               Palindrome checking as more than a second than Solution2(Trie2) where simple checking
               approach is done.
